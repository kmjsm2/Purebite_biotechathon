We engineer marbled, beef-like tissue by separately expanding muscle satellite and adipose (mesenchymal) cells on alginate hydrogel scaffolds, then 3D-bioprinting and bioreactor co-maturation to reproduce taste/texture. Process optimizations include Asc-2P for proliferation/differentiation support, sericin as an FBS alternative to reduce contamination/ethics risks, and targeted nutrient control for flavor and protein/fat ratios. The go-to-market plan targets Gen Z via social campaigns, with an infrastructure roadmap (cell banks, bioreactors, 3D printers), IP differentiation (integrated fatâ€“muscle bioink, scaffold strategy), and lifecycle emissions reduction via renewables and waste minimization.# Purebite_biotechathon
